# alicagatays_personal_webpage

## About

This codebase is the actual source code of my personal webpage at [alicagatay.github.io](https://alicagatay.github.io) written in Dart programming language and the Flutter framework.

## Why creating another repository for the same webpage

The other [repository named alicagatay.github.io](https://github.com/alicagatay/alicagatay.github.io) is only there for Github Pages to host the build files of my webpage that Flutter generated with the command `flutter build web`.

I have created this repository in order to source control and backup the actual Flutter project that contains the bone of my webpage.
